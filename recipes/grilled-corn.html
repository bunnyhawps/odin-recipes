    <h2>Why You Should Make This</h2>
    <p>This dish is perfect for an outdoor BBQ in the midst of summer.
        If you are craving some delicious, <em>nut-busting</em> corn bursting with <em>extreme</em> flavor, definitely try this out. It will also go great with some mashed potatoes and a nice juicy steak. What are you waiting for? Let's get started!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 c butter</li>
        <li>1/4 c chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>8 ears corn on the cob, unhusked</li>
        <li>3 qt cold water, or as needed to cover</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream butter in a bowl until that shit is <strong>SMOOTH!!</strong> Throw in the cilantro, lime juice, and cayenne pepper until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour to blend flavors to make it truly bang.</li>
        <li>Peel husks back from ears of corn starting at the top, but leave the husks attached at the bottom so it can look <em>aesthetic</em> as fuck. Cover corn ears with cold water in a large bowl until husks are soaked (about 20 minutes).</li>
        <li>Fire up the grill on medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place the corn in husks onto the hot grate and grill covered until husks are charred and kernels tender(20-25 minutes), turning that shit often. Strip off the husks off that <em>sexy-ass</em> corn and serve!</li>
    </ol>
