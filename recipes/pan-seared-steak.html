    <h2>Why You Should Make This</h2>
    <p>Should I even try to convince you to try this tasty recipe? It's <strong>steak</strong> for heaven's sake. Who doesn't like a nice, juicy, delicious, tender-ass steak like come on now! Before we get started I'll preface by saying I prefer a New York cut, but choose whatever you like. <strong><em>Let's make this shit.</em></strong> (I know you're hungry asf).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your choice of steak, obviously</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>a rosemary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First off you wanna pat dry them hoes. Unless you want oil to splatter and give you hell when you throw the steaks on the pan, soak the water out with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Alright, now time to <strong>season</strong> them muhfuckas with salt and pepper, <em>generously</em>. We don't want some bland-ass steak, so keep that in mind.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat the pan on medium heat and brush with oil; we don't want the steak sticking to the pan like your nuts in your underwear on a hot, sunny day. Even just 1/2 tbsp of oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li>Toss your steak(s) on the pan and sear each side 3-4 min until a brown crust forms and use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear the edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li>Melt in the butter with the garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt the pan to spoon the garlic butter over the steaks so that shit can marinate over and over again. Cook to desired doneness(but not well-done unless you wanna feel like you're eating a piece of cardboard).</li>
        <li>Remove the steak and rest 10 min before you begin slicing against the grain and voila!</li>
    </ol>
